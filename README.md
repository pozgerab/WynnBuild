# WynnBuild
_A mod for generating [WynnBuilder](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/) urls in-game._

## Usage
Opening your character info gui or ability tree will gather your info for your build. If you make changes to your build, make sure to manually fetch the info again with the **Read** button on the right bottom side of your screen.

Pressing the **BUILD** button in the bottom right side of your screen will generate and output your build url to the chat that you can copy and share.

_Note: the mod is still under development, more features, easier usage and QoL changes are yet to come._
