# WynnBuild
_A mod for generating [WynnBuilder](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/) urls in-game._

## Usage
After opening your character info gui, a **Read** button will appear on your screen. Clicking it will gather your character info. Opening the ability tree will automatically gather your atree info. If you make changes to your atree, make sure to manually fetch the info again with the **Read** button.

Pressing the **BUILD** button in the bottom right side of the character info menu will generate and output your build url to the chat that you can copy and share.

_Note: the mod is still in alpha, easier usage and QoL changes are yet to come._
